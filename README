read1.py - converts one sequence into SVM format.
Single_sequence - converts training sequence and testing sequence to SVM format. It also uses SVM to predict classification of the test sequence(inconsistent number of samples)
seq-data.txt - single sequence used for training
test.txt - single sequence used for testing.
single_seq_corrected.py - A program which converts training and testing sequence into SVM format and predicts the class of the test sequence(final predictor for single sequence)
model.py- creates a model for prediction using the file seq-data.txt
test-seq.py- Converts testing sequence into binary and calls model. It then predicts topolgy of the sequence used as test. The file testing.txt has contains sequence to be predicted.
Confusion.py - Creates a confusion matrix, uses data1.txt as input data.
model_fi.py -  Trains data and creates a model. This model will be saved and will be used for prediction. It uses seq-data_fi.txt as training data
test_seq_fi.py - It will take a test sequence, converts it to binary and the topolgy of this sequence is predicted. testing_fi.txt contains the protein sequence which is used as test. This is the final predictor!
